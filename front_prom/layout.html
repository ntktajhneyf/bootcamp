			<div class="story__text">
				<p>
					Wood has played an important role in the history of civilization.
					Humans have used it for fuel, building materials, furniture, paper, tools, weapons, and more.
					And demand for wood continues to increase annually, spurring conflicts between neighboring states
					over control of shared resources.
					Our relationship to this resource has remained relatively unchanged over time, and our <a href="#methods">methods of
					developing</a> and managing woodlands continue to rely on tried and true techniques
					established by early civilizations.
					So perhaps this is why we take it for granted: wood has long been a part of our lives,
					and we probably can't really imagine it not being there.
				</p>
				<div class="story__incut">Softwoods are the source of about 80% of the world’s lumber</div>
				<p>
					Anyone who has ever tried to light a fire knows that there are two types of wood:
					softwoods and hardwoods.
					For fires, hardwoods will burn hotter and longer—important factors when you're trying to ward off
					the chill—while softwoods will ignite more easily so it makes excellent kindling.
					Softwoods are the source of about 80% of the world’s lumber so when we talk about wood,
					more often than not, we're talking about softwoods.
					These woods include cedars, Douglas firs, cypresses, firs, junipers, kauris, larches, pines,
					hemlocks, redwoods, spruces, and yews.
					The wood from these trees tends to be <strong>more malleable</strong>.
					However, the softwood/hardwood division is not concrete: some softwoods are harder than
					some hardwoods.
					The Douglas fir and the yew listed above, for example, are actually mechanically
					harder than several hardwoods.
					In general, softwoods tend to be far less expensive in comparison to hardwoods <strike>and are used
					more frequently in construction.</strike>
